# My-First-BrainFuck-Programs
# 🧠 My First GitHub Project — Brainfuck Experiments

This is my first GitHub repository.  
It contains my Brainfuck programs — written from scratch and designed to understand how minimal computation works.

## ⚙️ About Brainfuck
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language that uses only 8 commands:
`> < + - . , [ ]`  
It operates on a simple memory tape, making it a great way to learn how logic and memory interact at the lowest level.

| `hello-world.bf` | Prints "Hello, World!"using loops(optimised version) |
| `pseudoname-simple.bf` | Prints my pseudoname (no loops). |
| `pseudoname-looped.bf` | Prints my pseudoname using loops (optimized version). |

## 📚 Future Goals
- Learn arithmetic operations (addition/subtraction)  
   
- Continue understanding the core of computation
